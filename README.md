This repository contains code that investigates the security of the blind signature scheme from eprint:2025/274. 

We analyze the security of the underlying hard problem, MIMCE, using an algebraic attack formulation via the solving a bilinear system of equations. 
Due to the similarities of this attack to the MEDS modeling, we estimate the security of MIMCE at different parameter levels using the MEDS modeling.
We also give an attack on a 2 sample instance, which is an improvement over the state-of-the-art for this style of problem.
